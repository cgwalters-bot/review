# The workflow check shared by the forge repositories: actionlint and
# zizmor at the versions pinned there, and its runner-label policy (no
# ubuntu-latest). It lives in the shared actions repository, so this takes
# the path of a checkout of it rather than naming or fetching one, and runs
# what that checkout holds: FORGE_ACTIONS (a relative path is from the
# repository root, wherever this is run from), else a sibling ../actions.
# It needs cargo and docker (CONTAINER=podman for podman). CI's ci job
# reaches the same Justfile through that repository's lint action.

# Check the workflows with the forge's shared actionlint, zizmor and runner-label check
